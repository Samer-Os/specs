/specify Build an intelligent conversational AI application named VIBEanalyzer for statistical analysis, targeting graduate students and researchers.

/specify The application's core innovation is to replace complex menu-driven interfaces with an intelligent, conversational AI that understands research context.

/specify The application must allow users to upload a dataset and describe their research question in natural language.

/specify VIBEanalyzer should analyze the dataset's characteristics and the user's query to intelligently recommend the most appropriate statistical methods.

/specify The method recommendations must be evidence-based by integrating with academic databases like PubMed and Google Scholar, and the system should provide academic citations to support its suggestions.

/specify The system must automatically execute the approved statistical analysis, including performing assumption checks and handling missing data or outliers.

/specify After executing an analysis, generate a comprehensive, publication-ready report in academic styles like APA, with options to export as PDF, Word, or LaTeX.

/specify The AI's interaction must be conversational, maintaining context throughout an analysis session to allow for follow-up questions and refinements.

/specify Implement a dataset intelligence feature that automatically analyzes an uploaded dataset to assess data quality and detect variable types.

/specify Include collaboration features that allow multiple users to work on the same project, with version control and annotations on analyses and reports.

/specify The application must be HIPAA compliant to handle sensitive healthcare data, featuring data encryption, audit logging, and role-based access control.

/specify Ensure academic integrity with proper source citation and plagiarism detection in generated reports.
