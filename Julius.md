/specify Build an AI data analyst application named Julius, designed for a wide range of roles including finance analysts, marketing teams, operations, business owners, and scientific researchers.
/specify The application must allow users to connect their data, ask questions in plain English, and receive insights and analysis without needing to write any code.
/specify The application must explicitly support connecting to a wide range of data sources, including spreadsheets (XLSX), documents (PDF), cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), databases (Postgres), and cloud storage (Google Drive).
/specify Implement a feature that provides context-rich analysis by connecting and synthesizing insights from different, separate data sources to "see the full story".
/specify The system should generate various outputs based on the user's analysis, such as interactive charts, data tables, and full reports.
/specify Create a library of pre-built analysis templates and notebooks for common business roles and tasks, such as "Balance sheet creation" for finance analysts and "Acquisition channel efficiency analysis" for marketing teams.
/specify Create an automated reporting feature that allows users to schedule reports and have them delivered automatically to platforms like Slack or via email.
/specify Provide an optional interface for advanced users to write and execute custom code in R, Python, or SQL for more complex or reproducible analysis.
/specify The AI should learn from a user's queries over time to better understand their specific business logic and surface more relevant insights.
/specify Ensure the application is secure and private, complying with industry standards like SOC 2 Type II, TX-RAMP, and GDPR, and guarantee that user data is never used for training AI models.
