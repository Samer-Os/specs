/specify Provide a feature for "Automated Workflows" that allows users to schedule data refreshes and report distribution on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
/specify Include collaboration features that allow users to share interactive visuals via a link or email and leave comments and annotations directly on charts to facilitate teamwork.
